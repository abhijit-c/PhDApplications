# PhDApplications

A Repository containing all of my applications for graduate school and the
summer of 2020.

## Places to Apply

### Math PhD
- Brown
- Duke
    - Work similar to Thomas P. Witelski.
- Georgia Tech
    - PhD in Computational Sciences and Engineering
- NC State
- NYU
- Rice
    - CAAM (Computational and Applied Math)
    - December 15th deadline (late deadline is January 15th)
    - Jesse Chan's research looks to be right up my wheelhouse.
        - Jesse Chanâ€™s research interests are in numerical methods for PDEs and
          scientific computing. More specifically, his recent work has focused
          on high order finite element and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods,
          provably stable methods for wave propagation and fluid dynamics,
          efficient high performance implementations on many-core and GPU
          architectures, and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods.
- University of British Columbia
- UMD
- UMich Ann Arbor
- UPenn
    - Their AMCS program has what I want.
    - Jim Haglund does computational number theory too, which is sweet.
    - January 1st deadline
- UT Austin
    - December 15th deadline

### Computer Science PhD
- Colorado Boulder
    - Their scientific computing program is under the CS department.
- University of Chicago
    - Computational Mathematics track in the computer science department.
    - Applying to their joint math/cs PhD.
