# PhDApplications

A Repository containing all of my applications for graduate school and the
summer of 2020.

***Professors:*** Once again, thanks for writing me a letter. I really
appreciate it. If you look above to the `GenericPersonalStatement.pdf` file,
you'll find the main body of the personal statement I'll be using for most of my
applications. Naturally I'll be tweaking it slightly per school, but the key
points are there for you, hopefully to make the process of writing easier.

## Places to Apply

### Math PhD
- Brown
- Duke
    - Work similar to Thomas P. Witelski.
- Georgia Tech
    - PhD in Computational Sciences and Engineering
- North Carolina State
- Northwestern
    - Unsure if I should do this one. The faculty seem to be way more pure, but
      there's a lot of interesting dynamical systems work here, so I struggle.
- New York University
- Rice
    - CAAM (Computational and Applied Math)
    - December 15th deadline (late deadline is January 15th)
    - Jesse Chan's research looks to be right up my wheelhouse.
        - Jesse Chanâ€™s research interests are in numerical methods for PDEs and
          scientific computing. More specifically, his recent work has focused
          on high order finite element and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods,
          provably stable methods for wave propagation and fluid dynamics,
          efficient high performance implementations on many-core and GPU
          architectures, and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods.
- Rutgers
    - Wujun Zhang does some interesting stuff on structure preserving
      discretizations of nonlinear PDEs. Fioralba Cakoni too in inverse
      problems.
    - December 15th deadline
- University of British Columbia
- University of Indiana
    - They run ISCAM
    - January 15th deadline
- University of Maryland
- University of Michigan Ann Arbor
- University of Penn State
    - Their AMCS program has what I want.
    - Jim Haglund does computational number theory too, which is sweet.
    - January 1st deadline
- University of Texas Austin
    - December 15th deadline
- University of Utah
    - Yekaterina Epshteyn does research close to what I like.
    - January 1st deadline

### Computer Science PhD
- Colorado Boulder
    - Their scientific computing program is under the CS department.
- University of Chicago
    - Computational Mathematics track in the computer science department.
    - Applying to their joint math/cs PhD.

### Summer 2020
