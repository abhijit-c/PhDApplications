# PhDApplications

A Repository containing all of my applications for graduate school and the
summer of 2020.

***Professors:*** Once again, thanks for writing me a letter. I really
appreciate it. If you look above to the `GenericPersonalStatement.pdf` file,
you'll find the main body of the personal statement I'll be using for most of my
applications. Naturally I'll be tweaking it slightly per school, but the key
points are there for you, hopefully to make the process of writing easier.

## Places to Apply

### Math PhD
- Brown
    - January 4th deadline
    - Mark Ainsworth does interesting stuff in FEM, i.e. *Preconditioning the
      mass matrix for high order finite element approximation on triangles.*
    - George Karniadakis solves PDE via ML, which sounds crazy, but
      unfortunately I know no ML so I can't tell how interesting this is.
      *Physics Informed Deep Learning (Part I): Data-driven Solutions of
      Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations*.
- Colorado State University
    - Febuary 1st deadline.
- Duke
    - Work similar to Thomas P. Witelski.
    - December 19th deadline.
- Georgia Tech
    - PhD in Computational Sciences and Engineering
    - December 20th deadline.
- North Carolina State
    - December 15th priority deadline, Febuary 1st official deadline.
- Northwestern
    - Unsure if I should do this one. The faculty seem to be way more pure, but
      there's a lot of interesting dynamical systems work here, so I struggle.
    - December 15th deadline.
- New York University
    - The research done by people in the fast algorithms group are close to what
      I like. For example Professor O'Neil's (although he's moved to MIT) work
      on boundary integral methods is interesting, and Professor Malhotra's
      PVFMM library is close to what I find interesting.
    - Similarily, Florial Wechsung's paper for augmenting the preconditioner for
      the 3D stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equation at high Reynolds
      number that he presented in the numerical analysis seminar was
      interesting.
    - December 15th deadline.
- Rice
    - CAAM (Computational and Applied Math)
    - December 15th deadline (late deadline is January 15th)
    - Jesse Chan's research looks to be right up my wheelhouse.
        - Jesse Chanâ€™s research interests are in numerical methods for PDEs and
          scientific computing. More specifically, his recent work has focused
          on high order finite element and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods,
          provably stable methods for wave propagation and fluid dynamics,
          efficient high performance implementations on many-core and GPU
          architectures, and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) methods.
- Rutgers
    - Wujun Zhang does some interesting stuff on structure preserving
      discretizations of nonlinear PDEs. Fioralba Cakoni too in inverse
      problems.
    - December 15th deadline
- University of British Columbia
    - December 31st deadline.
- University at Buffalo
    - January 15th deadline.
- UCLA
